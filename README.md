AI Caption Generator App Documentation

Overview

The AI Caption Generator App allows users to generate captions for various social media platforms using AI. The app uses a combination of pre-built components to handle image uploads, description input, and AI-based caption generation for platforms like Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok, and more. The generated captions can be rated, saved, and copied to the clipboard.

This documentation guides you through setting up the application locally, explains the app's functionality, and provides details about the various features.

Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed on your computer:

Node.js (version 16.x or later)

npm (comes with Node.js)

To check if you have Node.js and npm installed, run the following commands in your terminal:

node -v

npm -v

If not installed, visit the official Node.js website to download and install it.

Setting Up the Project

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository from GitHub (or the source of the app if you have access). Open your terminal and run:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-caption-generator.git

cd ai-caption-generator

Replace your-username with the actual GitHub username or repository URL.


2. Install Node Modules

Once inside the project directory, install the necessary dependencies by running:

npm install

This will download and install all the required node modules listed in the package.json file, including React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and any other dependencies.

3. Run the Development Serve
   
After installing the dependencies, you can run the app in development mode. To do so, execute the following command:

npm start

This will start the React development server, and you should be able to access the app at http://localhost:3000.

Project Structure

Here is a quick breakdown of the main files in the project:

src/

App.tsx: The main component of the app that handles all UI and functionality.

index.tsx: Entry point for the app where React renders the root component (App.tsx) to the DOM.

tailwind.config.js: TailwindCSS configuration file to customize the design.

postcss.config.js: Configuration for PostCSS, used to process TailwindCSS.

public/

index.html: The main HTML template for the React app.

package.json: Lists all the dependencies, scripts, and configurations for the project.

Features

1. Image Upload

Users can upload an image by dragging and dropping or by clicking the upload area. The image is displayed at the top of the form.

The image is optional and helps the AI generate more contextual captions.

Supported file types: JPG, PNG, and GIF.

Call-to-Action (CTA): Enable or disable a call-to-action in the caption to engage the audience.

6. AI Caption Generation

After filling in the required fields, users click the "Generate AI Captions" button.

The app uses predefined AI prompts to generate captions for the selected platform, tone, and mood.

The generated captions appear below the form, and users can copy them, rate them, or save them for future use.

The app uses TailwindCSS for styling, providing a clean and responsive layout. Some notable design aspects:

Dark Mode: The entire app is styled with a dark theme, which can be customized further by modifying the TailwindCSS configurations.

Gradient Backgrounds: Buttons and sections feature gradient backgrounds that match the platform and tone selections.

Interactive Elements: Hover effects, tooltips, and button animations add interactivity to the UI.

Scripts & Commands

1. npm start

Starts the development server at http://localhost:3000. Changes are automatically reflected in the browser.

2. npm run build

Creates a production-ready build of the app. The build will be stored in the build/ directory and can be deployed to hosting platforms.

4. npm run lint

Runs the linter to ensure that the code follows best practices and style guidelines.

5. npm run test

Runs the test suite for the app (if tests are added).
